CVSReview - View and review of changes in CVS Repositories
==========================================================

This software is a web-based application that provides a change-based view of
CVS repositories, instead of the common file-based view that reflects the
directory structure of the repository.

For that purpose the changes of all files in a repository are stored in a
database. This allows for a fast view of all recent changes in a repository.
Changes are grouped as changesets by taking into account commit message, commit
time and user.

The software is currently work-in-progress with change review, comment and approval
capabilites still missing.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
See the COPYING file for copyright information.
